INSTRUCTIONS : In this project you'll customize a web page to create a personal profile page. You'll modify the HTML and CSS for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text, and CSS. You'll put your finished project on GitHub, a website used by programmers and teams of programmers to share and work on their code.

This project is a great way for you to practice your HTML and CSS skills. It also gives you a web page you can use as a personal online calling card to advertise your experience, skills, and goals and to provide links to your social media accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub.

You'll also practice using GitHub, an important tool used by millions of developers to help share code and work collaboratively on programming projects. Creating and using a GitHub account is also a great way to share your work with potential employers.
